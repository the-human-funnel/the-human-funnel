- File validation and progress tracking
- Integration with job profile selection

### 3. Candidate Dashboard
- View all processed candidates with filtering and sorting
- Filter by job profile, processing stage, and minimum score
- Detailed candidate information with contact details
- Score breakdown and recommendation display
- Export individual candidate reports (PDF/CSV)

### 4. Real-time Progress Tracking
- Monitor batch processing status in real-time
- View processing statistics and estimated completion times
- Auto-refresh functionality for live updates
- Export batch reports when processing is complete

## Technology Stack

- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Material-UI (MUI)** for component library
- **MUI X Data Grid** for advanced table functionality
- **React Dropzone** for file upload
- **Axios** for API communication
- **Emotion** for styling

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ 
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

The application will open at `http://localhost:3001` and proxy API requests to `http://localhost:3000`.

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates a `build` folder with optimized production files that can be served by the backend.

## API Integration

The frontend communicates with the backend API through the following endpoints:

- **Job Profiles**: `/api/job-profiles`
- **Resume Upload**: `/api/resumes/upload-batch`
- **Candidates**: `/api/candidates`
- **Batch Processing**: `/api/batches`
- **Reports**: `/api/candidates/{id}/report`

## Environment Variables

- `REACT_APP_API_URL`: Backend API base URL (default: http://localhost:3000/api)
- `GENERATE_SOURCEMAP`: Whether to generate source maps (default: false)

## Development Notes

- The frontend uses a proxy configuration to route API calls to the backend during development
- Material-UI theme can be customized in `src/index.tsx`
- All API calls include automatic authentication token handling
- Error handling is implemented at the component level with user-friendly messages
