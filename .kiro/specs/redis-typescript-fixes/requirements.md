# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses TypeScript compilation errors in the Redis utility file that are preventing the application from starting. The errors are related to Redis client type mismatches, invalid socket configuration properties, and connection pool type incompatibilities. The goal is to fix these type issues while maintaining the existing Redis functionality and connection pooling features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the TypeScript compilation to succeed without errors, so that the application can start and run properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is compiled THEN there SHALL be no TypeScript errors related to Redis socket configuration
2. WHEN the application is compiled THEN there SHALL be no TypeScript errors related to Redis client type mismatches
3. WHEN the Redis utility is imported THEN it SHALL maintain all existing functionality

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper TypeScript types for Redis operations, so that I have compile-time safety and better IDE support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating Redis client configurations THEN the socket options SHALL use correct Redis TypeScript types
2. WHEN managing connection pools THEN the client types SHALL be properly handled
3. WHEN performing Redis operations THEN all type assertions SHALL be properly handled

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the Redis connection pooling and caching functionality to remain intact, so that application performance is not degraded.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the Redis connection pool SHALL be initialized successfully
2. WHEN Redis operations are performed THEN the connection optimization SHALL remain functional
3. WHEN the Redis client is accessed THEN all existing performance features SHALL continue to work
