# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses TypeScript compilation errors in the database utility file that are preventing the application from starting. The errors are related to MongoDB index creation type mismatches and read-only property assignments. The goal is to fix these type issues while maintaining the existing database functionality and performance optimizations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the TypeScript compilation to succeed without errors, so that the application can start and run properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is compiled THEN there SHALL be no TypeScript errors related to MongoDB index creation
2. WHEN the application is compiled THEN there SHALL be no TypeScript errors related to read preference assignment
3. WHEN the database utility is imported THEN it SHALL maintain all existing functionality

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper TypeScript types for MongoDB operations, so that I have compile-time safety and better IDE support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating database indexes THEN the index specifications SHALL use correct MongoDB TypeScript types
2. WHEN configuring database connection options THEN the configuration SHALL use proper MongoDB driver types
3. WHEN performing database operations THEN all type assertions SHALL be properly handled

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the database connection and indexing functionality to remain intact, so that application performance is not degraded.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN all database indexes SHALL be created successfully
2. WHEN database operations are performed THEN the connection optimization SHALL remain functional
3. WHEN the database is accessed THEN all existing performance features SHALL continue to work
